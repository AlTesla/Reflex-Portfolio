# This AlTeslaDataDev

I'm Alvaro Corona I was born and raised in Tijuana Mexico. I attended Baja California State University to obtain a bachellor's degree in AeroSpace Engineering. Additionally I earn a certification as a Data Analyst from the Monterrey Institute of Technology.

This is my personal web page where I showcase my programming skills, I began coding my college years. My first programing language was C++, which provided me with the basics. Later, delved into C# for game and animation development. I coded some fisics exercises and learned how to create methematical models and visualize patterns of motion using the physics principles, during college, I also studied Matlab, using it to solve mathematical problems through numerical methods and simulate electronic circuits.

Subsequently, I explored Arduinio and wrote code for vaious electronics projects, including a CANSAT. I also immersed myself in several drone projects, constructing both quadcopters and planes. These projects involved using microcontrollers to remotely pilot the drones. Understanding PID control and configuring the drones required significant effort.

After college I was working in a jewlery lightning project developing the hardware en and Iphone app to control the lighning device. this project conducted me to research a lot in a uncharted topics for me
