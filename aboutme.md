# About me 
I'm Alvaro Corona I was born and raised in Tijuana Mexico. I attended Baja California State University to obtain a bachellor's degree in AeroSpace Engineering. Additionally I earn a certification as a Data Analyst from the Monterrey Institute of Technology.

This is my personal web page where I showcase my programming skills, I began coding my college years. My first programing language was C++, which provided me with the basics. Later, delved into C# for game and animation development. I coded some fisics exercises and learned how to create methematical models and visualize patterns of motion using the physics principles, during college, I also studied Matlab, using it to solve mathematical problems through numerical methods and simulate electronic circuits.

Subsequently, I explored Arduinio and wrote code for vaious electronics projects, including a CANSAT. I also immersed myself in several drone projects, constructing both quadcopters and planes. These projects involved using microcontrollers to remotely pilot the drones. Understanding PID control and configuring the drones required significant effort.

Fresh out of college, I plunged headlong into an exhilarating project—an LED lightning masterpiece infused with jewelry-like hues. My dual mission: craft the hardware and design an iPhone app to wield this captivating lightning device. But fate had more in store for me than mere technology; it beckoned me toward uncharted territories.

In 2021, I decided to change careers. I began learning Python to stay connected with coding. Along the way, I stumbled upon data science topics. Although I didn’t know much about data science initially, it intrigued me. I developed a keen interest in data visualization and learned how to use some of the main data science libraries, such as Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, and Plotly.

Fast forward to 2023, when I enrolled in a data analyst certification program at one of the most important universities in Mexico. The journey was challenging, but I successfully obtained my certification. Now, I am ready to transition into a new career.

Currently, I am actively honing my coding skills, and this web page serves as a testament to my progress.
